# Project Switchblade
Hypothesis based mobile phone marketing analysis.  This project was conducted as part of Wittenberg University's ANLT 540 course, Descriptive, Predictive, and Prescriptive Analytics.

## Introduction
An email chain was provided describing the current status of Project Switchblade, an investigation into the fictional company Big Tech 3’s possible response to changes in the European mobile phone market conditions.  In addition to the email chain, five data files were provided:
*	European Customer Feature Survey
*	FreeMobile Contract Summary
*	Manufacturing Report
*	Model Line Features and Costs
*	Prior Year Sales Figures

Using information contained in the emails and data files, questions and requests for additional data were to be formulated.  Once received, a comprehensive analytics plan was built to address the problem, and preliminary analysis conducted with initial recommendations.

## Problem Definition 
Big Tech 3 is a company specializing in the production of mobile phones.  One of its biggest customers, FreeMobile, will begin to manufacture their own phones instead of purchasing them from Big Tech.  Since FreeMobile is the largest carrier in the European market, holding 45% ownership, this shift could have a significant impact on Big Tech’s sales and result in a loss of up to 40% market share by 2023.  This analysis plan investigates three hypotheses that could help compensate for this potential loss of revenue and market share.

## Deliverables 
Final deliverables for this project include:
* The [Final Report Markdown](https://github.com/mitchb63/Project_Switchblade/blob/main/deliverables/Project_Switchblade_Final_Report.pdf) (as PDF)
* The [Product Solver](https://github.com/mitchb63/Project_Switchblade/blob/main/deliverables/Product_Solver.xlsx), an Excel based production optimizer.
